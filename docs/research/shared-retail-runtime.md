# Shared retail runtime migration

Target: all fighters use one interpreter, retail-loaded roster/command/action/
stance/CPU tables, and shared native implementations. No fighter C definitions
or per-fighter script registrations remain in the target architecture. The
existing fighter modules are migration inputs, not the desired organization.

## Retail table reader

`game/retail_data.c` follows mk4decomp's `EventPacketDecoder` matching assembly
in `src/engine/input_check_cluster.c` (upstream 45de60, local 45de00): each
record consists of pattern, extra word and action word, terminated by a zero
pattern. An all-ones pattern is unconditional. The action word carries the
predicate index, action flags, input window and action index. Action flags
select the first matching dispatch table. Player-specific command-list roots
remain distinct; hidden characters keep their own input lists.

`StateDispatchTable` in `src/engine/state_dispatch_table.c` supplies the separate
16->2 / 17->7 remapping for stance/CPU selection. All addresses are checked
against the supplied EXE; upstream virtual addresses differ. Retail indices
are data, never host code pointers.

One shared fixture modifies source records and dispatch data in memory to
verify player selection, live reads, predicate/action decoding, termination
and the hidden-roster remap. It does not test individual character behavior.
